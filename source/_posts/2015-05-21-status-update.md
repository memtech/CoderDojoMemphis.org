In July of 2014 I registered CoderDojo Memphis.

Today I would like to introduce you to an initiative started by the Memphis Black Girls Code team called [Code Crew](http://www.code-crew.org/).

If you have found CoderDojo Memphis, you are probably trying to find somewhere to take kids to learn how to code.

Check out [Code Crew](http://www.code-crew.org/). I am really happy to see others leading this initiative in Memphis.

With the great people of Code Crew doing great things, I'm putting CoderDojo Memphis on the shelf for now.
